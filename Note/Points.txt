===========================================================
==> Constratcor
	static const
	public const

==> variable of class
	instance of class
	reference of class

==> access modifiers
	private
	protected
	public
	internal
	internal protected

==>Inheritance
1.Parent class constructor must be accessible to child class or else inheritance will not be possible 
2.inheritance child classes can access parent classes members but a parent class can never access its child class number
3.we can intialize the parent class variable by using its child class instance 

1.single
2.multi level
3.Hierarchical
4.Hybrid(multi level +Hierarchical)
5.multiple 

Static / Compile time Polymorohism / Method OverLoading / method name same diffrente signature (multiplexi)

Dynamic / Run-Time Polymorohism / Method Overriding / IS-A Relationship (parent child)

==>Method Overloading
	it's approches to implement multiple  method having same name but diffrent paramenter type it's called overloading

==> Method Overriding
	it's approch of re-implementing a parent classs method under the clid class with same signature.

	ex:-
	class1
	Test()

	class2 :class1
	Test()

	ex:- //Any virtual method of the parent class can be overriden by the child class
			//if required by using the override modifier
	 class1{
		 public virtual void Test() // overridable
	 }
	
	class2 :class1{
	 public override void Test() //overriding
	}

==> method hiding / Shadowing
